Two pointers..

Pointer is nothing but its variable
Variables means a way to store something



TwoPointer()
{

Initalization the pointers, Generally, we start with either

left =0, right = 0, or left =0, right = length-1;

when should be stop iterating ?
Generally iterate till:
left<right or Right< length-1

while(condition)
{
    if(condition)
    {
        // update the answer
    }
}


}
